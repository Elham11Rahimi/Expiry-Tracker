## Inspiration

Canadians are throwing out more food than they realize. In 2017, the National Zero Waste Council found that:
- 63% of the food Canadians throw away could have been eaten
- That‚Äôs 140 kg of food and $1,100 wasted per household per year
- Nationwide, that‚Äôs 2.2 million tonnes of edible food ‚Äî $17 billion lost
- Food waste also creates 9.8 million tonnes of CO‚ÇÇ ‚Äî like adding 2.1 million cars to the road

The problem? Most people overbuy groceries and then forget about them. We wanted to fix that.

# What It Does

Expiry Tracker uses OCR and image processing to extract expiry dates from grocery item labels, then displays those dates in a simple mobile app. So instead of digging through your fridge, you can check the app to see what‚Äôs about to expire ‚Äî from anywhere.

# How We Built It

We used:
- **OpenCV + Pytesseract** for image analysis and OCR
- **Kivy** to build the mobile app interface

# Challenges We Faced

- OCR needed image preprocessing ‚Äî contouring and enhancing images was tricky
- Kivy had a steep learning curve, especially under hackathon pressure

# Accomplishments

- Built a working app in just 24 hours
- Tackled multiple new tools (OpenCV, OCR, mobile UI)
- Worked as a team under tight time constraints and still delivered

# What We Learned

- Object-Oriented Programming is powerful (and tricky!)
- Hackathon skills can translate to real-world impact
- Building something quickly still teaches a ton

# What‚Äôs Next

- Scale to support inventory for retailers, restaurants, or warehouses
- Add notifications for soon-to-expire items
- Build partnerships with stores to notify users of discount items nearing expiry
